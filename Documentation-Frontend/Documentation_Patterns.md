# Documentation of Applied Design Patterns and Style

Design patterns and coding style are essential for code quality, scalability, and team collaboration.

- **Domain Driven Design (DDD):**  
  Separates the project into domain, infrastructure, application, and presentation layers. This makes the codebase easier to understand, test, and extend.

- **Componentization:**  
  Build small, focused, and reusable components. This reduces duplication and simplifies maintenance.

- **State Management:**  
  Use Pinia or Vuex for centralized state. Stores (e.g., `tracking.store.js`, `iam.store.js`) keep business logic out of components, making them easier to test and reuse.

- **Guards and Interceptors:**  
  Secure routes and handle authentication globally. Guards (`auth.guard.js`) restrict access based on user roles, while interceptors (`auth.interceptor.js`) manage API request/response logic.

- **Internationalization (i18n):**  
  Support multiple languages using the `locales/` folder and configuration in `i18n.js`. Components should use translation functions for all user-facing text.

- **Coding Style:**  
  - Use consistent naming conventions (`camelCase` for JS, `kebab-case` for components).
  - Write clear, concise comments and documentation.
  - Prefer the Composition API for new code.
  - Validate props and provide default values.
  - Avoid placing logic in templates; keep it in the script section.

**Best Practices:**  
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code consistency.
- Write unit tests for critical logic.
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
- Optimize performance (lazy loading, code splitting).
